Did you know that machine learning models can help you predict heart disease pretty accurately? In this project(on going), you can estimate your chance of heart disease (yes/no) in seconds!
Here, a Random Forest model using an oversampling technique was constructed using survey data of over 400k US residents from the year 2020. This application is based on it because it has proven to be better than the Logestic regression (it achieves an accuracy of about 86%, which is quite good).
To predict your heart disease status, simply follow the steps bellow:
Enter the parameters that best describe you;
Press the "Predict" button and wait for the result.
Keep in mind that this results is not equivalent to a medical diagnosis! This model would never be adopted by health care facilities because of its less than perfect accuracy, so if you have any problems, consult a human doctor.!
